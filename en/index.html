          <!-- <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2> -->
          <p>I'm a software designer with a master's degree in information processing science and experience from several software projects. Previously I have worked in an IT service company and as a software developer for research projects. My university studies in University of Oulu consisted mainly of software development, digital media and usability. I also have international experience from my exchange studies in the department of computer science in the University of Vienna.</p>
		  <br><br><br>
		  <p>I have years of experience with Java programming language, including typical Hibernate, Spring and Maven stack with experience from both back-end and front-end software design. During my earlier projects, I've had tasks ranging from requirements gathering and usability evaluation to database schema design and application deployment. In the future I'd like to do more front-end implementation and design.</p>
